Typesense Plone integration (WIP!)

Features
--------

- Indexing of all or partial content of the Plone site in Typesense.


Goals
-----

plone.typesense is meant to be a full Plone integration, including permissions/roles. 
You will be able to query Typesense directly from a client and also get all data from there. 
This much faster than quering Plone which queries Typesense and you have to full query power of Typesense. 
But everything inside Plone will work as expected. So plone.api/restapi should have all known api calls. 
But they are limited to what Plone offers with the default search.


Installation
------------

Install plone.typesense by adding it to your buildout::

    [buildout]

    ...

    eggs =
        plone.typesense


and then running ``bin/buildout``
