# TODO

- find a way to respect registered indexers when indexing content to Typesense
- allow choosing which indexes are indexed in Typesense and which are indexed in Plone's internal catalog
- use scoped token's to filter what the user can find
- filter out all fields with field level read permissions set, they can be fetch separately or added later with a separate Typesense collection
